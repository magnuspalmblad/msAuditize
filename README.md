# msAuditize

*msAuditize* is a collection of tools for converting mass spectrometry data of various types, as well as molecular (protein, RNA, DNA) sequences into sound. Sounds intriguing? Just take a listen to the examples. I also share a presentation from an after dinner talk at the 2014 Ardgour meeting where I speculated about the possibilities of exploring mass spectrometry data with the different senses, played a number of sounds made from raw mass spectrometry data and had people put their hands in a box with a 3D-printed LC-MS peptide feature, as well as look at some 3D images with anaglyphic glasses.
