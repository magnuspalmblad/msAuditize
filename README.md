# msAuditize

*msAuditize* is a collection of tools for converting mass spectrometry data of various types, as well as molecular (protein, RNA, DNA) sequences into sound. Sounds intriguing? Just take a listen to the examples.

I also share a presentation here from an after dinner talk at the 2014 Ardgour meeting where I speculated about the possibilities of exploring mass spectrometry data with the different senses, played a number of sounds made from raw mass spectrometry data and had people put their hands in a box with a 3D-printed LC-MS peptide feature, as well as look at some 3D images with anaglyphic glasses. I remember the presentation was very well received at the time, though the fact that the audience could enjoy a glass or two of wine during the talk may have had something to do with this.

My original 2007 code for converting mzXML to STL for 3D printing can be found in the [mzXML2stl](https://github.com/magnuspalmblad/mzXML2stl) repository.
